# Monstero by Team HOBL
Monstero is a wearable that aims to improve kids self esteem by encouraging them to exercise. It has a watch like interface but contains a creature which the user has to look after. In order to make the creature grow and get stronger, the user must exercise. Through using the user's heart rate the monster will grow and become stronger. If the user doesn't exercise for a while the monster will become smaller and weaker. The user can also interact with other people with Monstero through a high-five or shaking hands in order to battle them or become friends.
